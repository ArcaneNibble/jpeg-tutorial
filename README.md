This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to decode and encode a JPEG image from scratch, as well as explaining all of the theory and algorithms involved.

It'll enable you to make horrors such as this:

or this:

![corrupted Tux the penguin #2](ipnh_example2.jpg)

In the process, you'll hopefully learn a lot of useful tools for understanding compression and multimedia more generally.
